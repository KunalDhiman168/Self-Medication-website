# Self Medication Portal
This project aims to promote awareness and responsible practices in self-medication through a user-friendly web application. By combining survey-driven insights and medical data, the platform helps users identify common symptoms and suggests basic over-the-counter remedies‚Äîencouraging safe self-care while emphasizing when to seek professional help.

# Project Overview
Self-medication is a growing trend, but improper practices can lead to severe health risks. To address this, we conducted a large-scale public survey to understand common health concerns, treatment habits, and gaps in awareness. Based on the results, we developed a web application that provides:

- Guidance for safe self-medication for common ailments.

- Recommendations for over-the-counter (OTC) medications.

- Alerts for symptoms that require professional consultation.

This project bridges the gap between basic healthcare access and informed decision-making in self-care.

# How It Works
- User visits the web app and enters their symptoms from a pre-defined list.

- The app suggests common OTC medicines and care tips for mild conditions like headache, cold, fever, acidity, etc.

- If serious symptoms are detected, the app issues a warning and advises visiting a doctor.

- Anonymous data is collected (if permitted by user) to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggestions based on real-world use cases.

# Survey Methodology
- Conducted using Google Forms, reaching over X00+ participants across various age groups.

- Survey collected data on:

     - Most common self-medicated conditions.

     - Frequently used OTC drugs.

     - Frequency of doctor consultation.

- Insights were used to train the symptom-to-treatment mapping logic in the app.

# Future Improvements
- Integrate symptom prediction using machine learning.

- Add multilingual support for better accessibility.

- Implement login functionality and health tracking history for regular users.

- Connect to a medical database API for real-time medication info.
